☐ 404 Page: Guybrush running out of air or Purple Tentacle taking over the world
☐ Either semi-hide "Here be dragons" text and fade in/out during hover (can probably be done with a bit of CSS goodness) or use the red marker/strikethrough

☐ Add "Legacy" sidebar submenu
  ☐ Copy over my original blog article "Adventures in SCUMM"
  ☐ Link to iMuse video/GitHub issue
  ☐ SCUMM University Handbook (either as PDF download or, better yet, converted to Markdown)
